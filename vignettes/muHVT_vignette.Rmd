# Abstract

The muHVT package is a collection of R functions to facilitate building [topology preserving maps](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-84628-118-0_7) for rich multivariate data. Tending towards a big data preponderance, a large number of rows. A collection of R functions for this typical workflow is organized below :

1.  **Data Compression**: Vector quantization (VQ), HVQ (hierarchical vector quantization) using means or medians. This step compresses the rows (long data frame) using a compression objective

2.  **Data Projection**: Dimension projection of the compressed cells to 1D,2D and 3D with the Sammons Non-linear Algorithm. This step creates topology preserving map (also called as [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding)) coordinates into the desired output dimension . 

3.  **Tessellation**: Create cells required for object visualization using the Voronoi Tessellation method, package includes heatmap plots for hierarchical Voronoi tessellations (HVT). This step enables data insights, visualization, and interaction with the topology preserving map. Useful for semi-supervised tasks

4.  **Prediction**: Scoring new data sets and recording their assignment using the map objects from the above steps, in a sequence of maps if required


# Data Compression

Compression is a technique used to reduce the data size while preserving its essential information, allowing for efficient storage and decompression to reconstruct the original data. While Vector quantization (VQ) is a technique used in data compression to represent a set of data points with a smaller number of representative vectors. It achieves compression by exploiting redundancies or patterns in the data and replacing similar data points with representative vectors.


This package offers several advantages for performing data compression as it is designed to handle `high-dimensional data` more efficiently. It provides a `hierarchical compression approach`, allowing  multi-resolution representation of the data. The hierarchical structure enables `efficient compression` and `storage` of the data while preserving different levels of detail. HVT aims to preserve the topological structure of the data during compression.`Spatial data` with `irregular shapes` and complex structures in high-dimensional data can contain valuable information about relationships and patterns. HVT seeks to capture and retain these topological characteristics, enabling meaningful analysis and visualization.This package employs tessellation to divide the compressed data space into distinct cells or regions while preserving the topology of the original data. This means that the relationships and connectivity between data points are maintained in the compressed representation.


This package can perform vector quantization using the following algorithms - 

*  Hierarchical Vector Quantization using $k-means$ 
*  Hierarchical Vector Quantization using $k-medoids$


## Hierarchical Vector Quantization

###  Using k-means

1. The k-means algorithm randomly selects *k* data points as initial means
1. *k* clusters are formed by assigning each data point to its closest cluster mean using the Euclidean distance
1. Virtual means for each cluster are calculated by using all datapoints contained in a cluster

The second and third steps are iterated until a predefined number of iterations is reached or the clusters converge. The runtime for the algorithm is O(n).

###  Using k-medoids

1.  The k-medoids algorithm randomly selects *k* data points as initial
    means out of the n data points as the medoids.
2.  *k* clusters are formed by assigning each data point to its closest
    medoid by using any common distance metric methods.
3.  Virtual means for each cluster are calculated by using all
    datapoints contained in a cluster

The second and third steps are iterated until a predefined number of
iterations is reached or the clusters converge. The runtime for the
algorithm is O(k \* (n-k)\^2) .


These algorithm divides the dataset recursively into cells using $k-means$
or $k-medoids$ algorithm. The maximum number of subsets are decided by
setting $n_cells$ to, say five, in order to divide the dataset into
maximum of five subsets. These five subsets are further divided into
five subsets(or less), resulting in a total of twenty five (5\*5)
subsets. The recursion terminates when the cells either contain less
than three data point or a stop criterion is reached. In this case, the
stop criterion is set to when the cell error exceeds the quantization
threshold.

The steps for this method are as follows :

1. Select k(number of cells), depth and quantization error threshold
1. Perform quantization (using $k-means$ or $k-medoids$) on the input dataset
1. Calculate quantization error for each of the k cells
1. Compare the quantization error for each cell to quantization error threshold
1. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each of the k cells whose quantization error is above threshold until stop criterion is reached.

The stop criterion is when the quantization error of a cell  satisfies one of the below conditions 

* reaches below quantization error threshold
* there are less than three data points in the cell
* the user specified depth has been attained

The quantization error for a cell is defined as follows :

$$QE  = \max_i(||A-F_i||_{p})$$ 


where 

*  $A$ is the centroid of the cell
*  $F_i$ represents a data point in the cell 
*  $m$ is the number of points in the cell
*  $p$ is the $p$-norm metric. Here $p$ = 1 represents L1 Norm and $p$ = 2 represents L2 Norm.

###  Quantization Error

Let us try to understand quantization error with an example.

```{r Quantization Error,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',message=FALSE,out.width='90%',fig.height=8,fig.cap='Figure 1: The Voronoi tessellation for level 1 shown for the 5 cells with the points overlayed'}
knitr::include_graphics('quant_explainer.png')
```

An example of a 2 dimensional VQ is shown above.

In the above image, we can see 5 cells with each cell containing a certain number of points. The centroid for each cell is shown in blue. These centroids are also known as codewords since they represent all the points in that cell. The set of all codewords is called a codebook.

Now we want to calculate quantization error for each cell. For the sake of simplicity, let's consider only one cell having centroid `A` and `m` data points $F_i$ for calculating quantization error.

For each point, we calculate the distance between the point and the centroid.

$$ d = ||A - F_i||_{p} $$

In the above equation, p = 1 means `L1_Norm` distance whereas p = 2 means `L2_Norm` distance. In the package, the `L1_Norm` distance is chosen by default. The user can pass either `L1_Norm`, `L2_Norm` or a custom function to calculate the distance between two points in n dimensions.

$$QE  = \max_i(||A-F_i||_{p})$$ 


Now, we take the maximum calculated distance of all m points. This gives us the furthest distance of a point in the cell from the centroid, which we refer to as `Quantization Error`. If the Quantization Error is higher than the given threshold, the centroid/ codevector is not a good representation for the points in the cell. Now we can perform further Vector Quantization on these points and repeat the above steps.

Please note that the user can select mean, max or any custom function to calculate the Quantization Error. The custom function takes a vector of m value (where each value is a distance between point in `n` dimensions and centroids) and returns a single value which is the Quantization Error for the cell.

If we select `mean` as the error metric, the above Quantization Error equation will look like this :  

$$QE  = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m||A-F_i||_{p}$$ 

# Data Projection

Projection mainly involves converting data from its original form to a different space or coordinate system while preserving certain properties of it. By projecting data into a common coordinate system, spatial relationships, distances, areas, and other spatial attributes can be accurately measured and compared.

HVT performs projection as part of its workflow to visualize and explore high-dimensional data. The projection step in HVT involves mapping the compressed data, represented by the hierarchical structure of cells, onto a lower-dimensional space for visualization purposes, as human perception is more suited to interpreting information in lower-dimensional spaces.Users can zoom in/out, rotate, and explore different regions of the projected space to gain insights and understand the data from different perspectives.


Sammon's projection is an algorithm used in this package to map a high-dimensional space to a space of lower dimensionality while attempting to preserve the structure of inter-point distances in the projection. It is particularly suited for use in exploratory data analysis and is usually considered a non-linear approach since the mapping cannot be represented as a linear combination of the original variables. The centroids are plotted in 2D after performing Sammon’s projection at every level of the tessellation.


Denoting the distance between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ objects in the original space by $d_{ij}^*$, and the distance between their projections by $d_{ij}$. Sammon’s mapping aims to minimize the below error function, which is often referred to as Sammon’s stress or Sammon’s error

$$E=\frac{1}{\sum_{i<j} d_{ij}^*}\sum_{i<j}\frac{(d_{ij}^*-d_{ij})^2}{d_{ij}^*}$$

The minimization  of this can be performed either by gradient descent, as proposed initially, or by other means, usually involving iterative methods. The number of iterations need to be experimentally determined and convergent solutions are not always guaranteed. Many implementations prefer to use the first Principal Components as a starting configuration.

# Tessellations

A Voronoi diagram is a way of dividing space into a number of regions. A set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand and for each seed, there will be a corresponding region consisting of all points within proximity of that seed. These regions are called `Voronoi cells`. It is complementary to `Delaunay triangulation` is a geometrical algorithm used to create a triangulated mesh from a set of points in a plane which has the property that no data point lies within the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation. This property guarantees that the resulting cells in the tessellation do not overlap with each other. 

By using `Delaunay triangulation`, HVT can achieve a partitioning of the data space into distinct and non-overlapping regions, which is crucial for accurately representing and analyzing the compressed data.Additionally, the use of Delaunay triangulation for tessellation ensures that the resulting cells have well-defined shapes, typically triangles in two dimensions or tetrahedra in three dimensions. 

The hierarchical structure resulting from tessellation preserves the inherent structure and relationships within the data. It captures clusters, subclusters, and other patterns in the data, allowing for a more organized and interpretable representation.
The hierarchical structure reduces redundancy and enables more compact representations

**Tessellate: Constructing Voronoi Tesselations**

In this package, we use `sammons` from the package `MASS` to project higher dimensional data to a 2D space. The function `hvq` called from the `HVT` function returns hierarchical quantized data which will be the input for construction of the tessellations. The data is then represented in 2D coordinates and the tessellations are plotted using these coordinates as centroids. We use the package `deldir` for this purpose. The `deldir` package computes the Delaunay triangulation (and hence the Dirichlet or Voronoi tessellation) of a planar point set according to the second (iterative) algorithm of Lee and Schacter. For subsequent levels, transformation is performed on the 2D coordinates to get all the points within its parent tile. Tessellations are plotted using these transformed points as centroids. The lines in the tessellations are chopped in places so that they do not protrude outside the parent polygon. This is done for all the subsequent levels.

# Prediction


Prediction basically refers to the process of making predictions or estimating future values or outcomes based on existing data patterns.In data prediction, a model is developed based on historical data or a training dataset, and this model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model captures the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships present in the training data, allowing it to make informed predictions on similar or related data points.

In this package, we use `predictHVT` function to predict each point in the test dataset 

**Prediction Algorithm**

The prediction algorithm recursively calculates the distance between each point in the test dataset and the cell centroids for each level. The following steps explain the prediction method for a single point in the test dataset :

1. Calculate the distance between the point and the centroid of all the cells in the first level
2. Find the cell whose centroid has minimum distance to the point
3. Check if the cell drills down further to form more cells
4. If it doesn’t, return the path. Or else repeat steps 1 to 4 till we reach a level at which the cell doesn’t drill down further

# Example I: muHVT with the Torus dataset

**In this section, we will see how we can use the package to visualize multidimensional data by projecting them to two dimensions using Sammon's projection and further used for scoring**

**Data Understanding**

First of all, let us see how to generate data for torus. We are using a library `geozoo` for this purpose. Geo Zoo (stands for Geometric Zoo) is a compilation of geometric objects ranging from three to 10 dimensions. Geo Zoo contains regular or well-known objects, eg cube and sphere, and some abstract objects, e.g. Boy's surface, Torus and Hyper-Torus. 

Here, we will generate a 3D torus (a torus is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space one full revolution about an axis that is coplanar with the circle) with 9000 points.

Let us first split the torus data into train and test. We will use 9000 data points as train and remaining 3000 data points as test.

```{r torus generate,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,results="hide",eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
# Here p represents dimension of object
# n represents number of points
torus <- geozoo::torus(p = 3,n = 12000)
torus_df <- data.frame(torus$points)
torus_df1 <- torus_df %>% round(4)
colnames(torus_df) <- c("x","y","z")
```

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
noOfPoints <- dim(torus_df)[1]
trainTorus <- torus_df[1:9000,]
trainTorus1 <- trainTorus %>% round(4)
testTorus <- torus_df[9001:noOfPoints,]
```

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
torus_df<-trainTorus
```

Now let's do some EDA on the data. First of all, we will see how the training data looks like. For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.

```{r torus head, warning=FALSE, eval = global_var}

Table(head(trainTorus1))

```

Now let's have a look at structure and summary of the data.

```{r torus structure, warning=FALSE, eval = global_var}
str(torus_df)
```

```{r torus summary, warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}
summary(torus_df)
```

Now let's try to visualize the torus (donut) in  3D Space.

```{r eval=F,echo=F}
# library(rgl)
# plotids <- plot3d(torus_df$x, torus_df$y, torus_df$z,
#                   type = "p", col = c("blue", "red"),  #col = c("white", "red")
#                   xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", zlab = "Z",box=T,
#                   xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5), zlim = c(-5, 5))
# 
# 
# 
# rglwidget(elementId = "plot3drgl")


```


```{r torus plot,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.show="hold",fig.cap='Figure 2: 3D Torus',eval =TRUE,echo=TRUE}

plot_torus <- plotly::plot_ly(torus_df, x= ~x, y= ~y, z = ~z) %>% add_markers( marker = list(
                          size = 2,
                          symbol = "circle",
                          color = ~z,
                          colorscale = "Bluered",
                          colorbar = (list(title = 'z_var'))))
plot_torus

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('torus_donut.png')
```

<!-- ## Execution of Workflow Steps at Level 1 -->

**Note: The steps of compression, projection, and tessellation are iteratively performed until a minimum compression rate of 80% is achieved. Once the desired compression is attained, the resulting model object is used for scoring using the predictHVT() function**

In this section all the outlined workflow steps provided in the abstract section (Compression, Projection, Tessellation and Prediction) are executed at level 1.

## Step 1: Data Compression

The core function for compression in the workflow is `HVQ`, which is called within the `HVT` function. we have a parameter called quantization error. This parameter acts as a threshold and determines the number of levels in the hierarchy. It means that, if there are 'n' number of levels in the hierarchy, then all the clusters formed till this level will have quantization error equal or greater than the threshold quantization error. The user can define the number of clusters in the first level of hierarchy and then each cluster in first level is sub-divided into the same number of clusters as there are in the first level. This process continues and each group is divided into smaller clusters as long as thethreshold quantization error is met. The output of this technique will be hierarchically arranged vector quantized data.

However, let's try to comprehend the **HVT function** first before moving on. 

 
```{r HVT function, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
HVT(
  dataset,
  min_compression_perc,
  n_cells,
  depth,
  quant.err,
  projection.scale,
  normalize = T,
  distance_metric = c("L1_Norm", "L2_Norm"),
  error_metric = c("mean", "max"),
  quant_method = c("kmeans", "kmedoids"),
  diagnose = TRUE,
  hvt_validation = FALSE,
  train_validation_split_ratio = 0.8
)
```

Each of the parameters of HVT function have been explained below :

* __`dataset`__ - A dataframe with numeric columns 

* __`min_compression_perc`__ - An integer indicating the minimum percent compression rate to be achieved for the dataset

* __`n_cells`__  - An integer indicating the number of cells per hierarchy (layers)

* __`depth`__   - An integer indicating the number of layers. (1 = No hierarchy, 2 = 2 layers, etc ...)

* __`quant.error`__ - A number indicating the quantization error threshold. A cell will only breakdown
into further cells if the quantization error of the cell is above the defined quantization error threshold

* __`distance_metric`__	- The distance metric can be `L1_Norm` or `L2_Norm`. `L1_Norm` is selected by default. The distance metric is used to calculate the distance between an `n` dimensional point and centroid. The user can also pass a custom function to calculate this distance

* __`error_metric`__ - The error metric can be `mean` or `max`. `max` is selected by default. `max` will return the max of `m` values and `mean` will take mean of `m` values where each value is a distance between a point and centroid of the cell. Moreover, the user can also pass a custom function to calculate the error metric

* __`quant_method`__ - The quantization method can be `kmeans` or `kmedoids`. `kmeans` is selected by default
    
* __`normalize`__	- A logical value indicating whether the columns in your dataset need to be normalized. Default value is TRUE. The algorithm supports Z-score normalization

* __`diagnose`__ - A logical value indicating whether user wants to perform diagnostics on the model. Default value is TRUE.

* __`hvt_validation`__ - A logical value indicating whether user wants to holdout a validation set and find mean absolute deviation of the validation points from the centroid. Default value is FALSE.

* __`train_validation_split_ratio`__ - A numeric value indicating train validation split ratio. This argument is only used when hvt_validation has been set to TRUE. Default value for the argument is 0.8



We will use the `HVT` function to compress our data while preserving essential features of the dataset. Our goal is to achieve data compression upto atleast `80%`. In situations where the compression ratio does not meet the desired target, we can explore adjusting the model parameters as a potential solution. This involves making modifications to parameters such as the `quantization error threshold` or `increasing the number of cells` and then rerunning the HVT function again.

**In our example we will iteratively increase the number of cells until the desired compression percentage is reached instead of increasing the quantization threshold because it may reduce the level of detail captured in the data representation**


We will pass the below mentioned model parameters along with torus dataset to `HVT` function.


**Model Parameters**

* Number of Cells at each Level = 100
* Maximum Depth = 1
* Quantization Error Threshold = 0.1
* Error Metric = Max
* Distance Metric = Manhattan

```{r torus hvt first,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 6: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 100 cells in the dataset ’torus’',eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
hvt.torus <- muHVT::HVT(
  torus_df,
  n_cells = 100,
  depth = 1,
  quant.err = 0.1,
  projection.scale = 10,
  normalize = T,
  distance_metric = "L1_Norm",
  error_metric = "max",
  quant_method = "kmeans"
)

```

Let's checkout the compression summary . 

```{r compression summary torus first,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}
compressionSummaryTable(hvt.torus[[3]]$compression_summary)
```


**As it can be seen from the table above, none of the 100 cells have reached the quantization threshold error. Therefore we can further subdivide the cells by increasing the n_cells parameters and then see if desired compression (80%) is reached**


## Step 2: Data Projection

The function `sammonsProjection()` utilizes the `sammons` function from the MASS package being called in `HVT`. Sammon's projection is an algorithm that maps a high-dimensional space to a space of lower dimensionality while attempting to preserve the structure of inter-point distances in the projection.The centroids are plotted in 2D after performing Sammon’s projection at every level of the tessellation.

lets view the projected 2D centroids after performing sammon's projection. For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.


```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

hvt_torus_coordinates <-hvt.torus[[2]][[1]][["1"]]
centroids <<- list()
  coordinates_value <- lapply(1:length(hvt_torus_coordinates), function(x){
    centroids <-hvt_torus_coordinates[[x]]
    coordinates <- centroids$pt
  })
centroid_coordinates<<- do.call(rbind.data.frame, coordinates_value)  
colnames(centroid_coordinates) <- c("x","y")
centroid_coordinates <- centroid_coordinates %>% data.frame() %>% round(4)
Table(head(centroid_coordinates), scroll = T, limit = 20)

```

## Step 3: Tessellation

The `deldir` package computes the Delaunay triangulation (and hence the Dirichlet or Voronoi tessellation) of a planar point set according to the second (iterative) algorithm of Lee and Schacter. For subsequent levels, transformation is performed on the 2D coordinates to get all the points within its parent tile. Tessellations are plotted using these transformed points as centroids.

`plotHVT` is the main function to plot hierarchical voronoi tessellations.


Now let's try to understand **plotHVT** function. The parameters have been explained in detail below

```{r plotHVT function,echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
plotHVT(hvt.results, line.width, color.vec, pch1 = 21, centroid.size = 3, title = NULL, maxDepth = 1)
```

* __`hvt.results`__ -  A list containing the output of the HVT function which has the details of the tessellations to be plotted

* __`line.width`__	- A vector indicating the line widths of the tessellation boundaries for each layer

* __`color.vec`__	- A vector indicating the colors of the tessellations boundaries at each layer

* __`pch1`__	- Symbol type of the centroids of the tessellations (parent levels). Refer points (default = 21)

* __`centroid.size`__	- Size of centroids of first level tessellations (default = 3)

* __`title`__	- Set a title for the plot (default = NULL)

For better visualisation, let's plot the Voronoi tessellation.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 3: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 100 cells in the dataset ’torus’'}
muHVT::plotHVT(
  hvt.torus,
  line.width = c(0.4),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  centroid.size = 0.6,
  maxDepth = 1
)
```

Since, we are yet to achive atleast 80% compression. Let's try to compress again using the below mentioned set of model parameters.

**Step 1: Data Compression**

For more detailed information on Data Compression please refer to [section 2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#compress-vector-quantization) of this vignette.

**Model Parameters**

* Number of Cells at each Level = 300
* Maximum Depth = 1
* Quantization Error Threshold = 0.1
* Error Metric = Max
* Distance Metric = Manhattan


```{r torus hvt second,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 8: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 300 cells in the dataset ’torus’',eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
hvt.torus2 <- muHVT::HVT(
  torus_df,
  n_cells = 300,
  depth = 1,
  quant.err = 0.1,
  projection.scale = 10,
  normalize = T,
  distance_metric = "L1_Norm",
  error_metric = "max",
  quant_method = "kmeans"
)

```


Let's checkout the compression summary again.

```{r compression summary torus second,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}
compressionSummaryTable(hvt.torus2[[3]]$compression_summary)
```

**It can be observed from the table above that only 43 cells out of 300 i.e. `14%` of the cells reached the Quantization Error threshold. Therefore we can further subdivide the cells by increasing the n_cells parameters and then see if 80% compression is reached **

**Step 2: Data Projection**

For more detailed information on Data Projection please refer to [section 3](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#projection) of this vignette.

Now, lets view the projected 2D centroids after performing sammon's projection. For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.


```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

hvt_torus_coordinates <-hvt.torus2[[2]][[1]][["1"]]
centroids <<- list()
  coordinates_value <- lapply(1:length(hvt_torus_coordinates), function(x){
    centroids <-hvt_torus_coordinates[[x]]
    coordinates <- centroids$pt
  })
centroid_coordinates<<- do.call(rbind.data.frame, coordinates_value)  
colnames(centroid_coordinates) <- c("x","y")
centroid_coordinates <- centroid_coordinates %>% data.frame() %>% round(4)
Table(head(centroid_coordinates), scroll = T, limit = 20)

```

**Step 3: Tessellation**

For more detailed information on Voronoi Tessellation please refer to [section 4](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#voronoi-tessellations) of this vignette.

For better visualisation, let's plot the Voronoi tessellation.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 4: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 300 cells in the dataset ’torus’'}
muHVT::plotHVT(
  hvt.torus2,
  line.width = c(0.4),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  centroid.size = 0.6,
  maxDepth = 1
)
```

Now let's try again with the below mentioned set of model parameters and see whether we achieve a compression rate of up to 80%:


**Step 1: Data Compression**

**Model Parameters**

* Number of Cells at each Level = 900
* Maximum Depth = 1
* Quantization Error Threshold = 0.1
* Error Metric = Max
* Distance Metric = Manhattan

```{r torus hvt third ,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 10: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 900 cells in the dataset ’torus’',eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
hvt.torus3 <- muHVT::HVT(
  torus_df,
  n_cells = 900,
  depth = 1,
  quant.err = 0.1,
  projection.scale = 10,
  normalize = T,
  distance_metric = "L1_Norm",
  error_metric = "max",
  quant_method = "kmeans"
)

```


Let's check the compression summary for torus.

```{r compression summary torus third,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}
compressionSummaryTable(hvt.torus3[[3]]$compression_summary)
```

**By increasing the number of cells to 900, we were successfully able to compress `93%` of the data, so we will not further subdivide the cells**

**Step 2: Data Projection**

Now, lets view the projected 2D centroids after performing sammon's projection. For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.


```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

hvt_torus_coordinates <-hvt.torus3[[2]][[1]][["1"]]
centroids <<- list()
  coordinates_value <- lapply(1:length(hvt_torus_coordinates), function(x){
    centroids <-hvt_torus_coordinates[[x]]
    coordinates <- centroids$pt
  })
centroid_coordinates<<- do.call(rbind.data.frame, coordinates_value)  
colnames(centroid_coordinates) <- c("x","y")
centroid_coordinates <- centroid_coordinates %>% data.frame() %>% round(4)
Table(head(centroid_coordinates), scroll = T, limit = 20)

```

**Step 3: Tessellation**

For better visualisation, let's plot the Voronoi tessellation.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 5: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 900 cells in the dataset ’torus’'}
muHVT::plotHVT(
  hvt.torus3,
  line.width = c(0.4),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  centroid.size = 0.6,
  maxDepth = 1
)
```

**From the presented plot, the inherent structure of the donut can be easily observed in the two-dimensional space**

We will now overlay all the features as heatmap over the Voronoi Tessellation plot for better visualization and identification of patterns, trends, and variations in the data. .

Let's have look at the `hvtHmap` function which we will use to overlay a variable as heatmap.

```{r hvtHmap function demo,echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
hvtHmap(hvt.results, dataset, child.level, hmap.cols, color.vec ,line.width, palette.color = 6)
```

* __`hvt.results`__ - A list of results obtained from the HVT function

* __`dataset`__	- A dataframe containing the variables to overlay as a heatmap. The user can pass an external dataset or the dataset that was used to perform hierarchical vector quantization. The dataset should have the same number of points as the dataset used to perform hierarchical Vector Quantization in the HVT function

* __`child.level`__	- A number indicating the level for which the heat map is to be plotted

* __`hmap.cols`__	- The column number of column name from the dataset indicating the variables for which the heat map is to be plotted. To plot the quantization error as heatmap, pass `'quant_error'`. Similarly to plot the no of points in each cell as heatmap, pass `'no_of_points'` as a parameter

* __`color.vec`__	- A color vector such that length(color.vec) = child.level (default = NULL)

* __`line.width`__ - A line width vector such that length(line.width) = child.level (default = NULL)

* __`palette.color`__ - A number indicating the heat map color palette. 1 - rainbow, 2 - heat.colors, 3 - terrain.colors, 4 - topo.colors, 5 - cm.colors, 6 - BlCyGrYlRd (Blue,Cyan,Green,Yellow,Red) color (default = 6)

* __`show.points`__ - A boolean indicating whether the centroids should be plotted on the tessellations (default = FALSE)



Now let’s plot the Voronoi Tessellation with the heatmap overlaid for all the features in the torus data for better visualization and interpretation of data patterns and distributions.



<!-- ```{r hmp level two quantization torus3 demo,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 11: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 and number of cells 900 with the heat map overlaid for all the variable in the ’torus’ dataset',eval = global_var} -->

<!-- ``` -->

**The heatmaps displayed below provides a visual representation of the spatial characteristics of the torus, allowing us to observe patterns and trends in the distribution of each of the features (X,Y and Z). The <span style="color: #8FD400;">sheer green</span>  shades highlight regions with higher coordinate values in each of the heatmaps, while the <span style="color: indigo;">indigo</span>  shades indicate areas with the lowest coordinate values in each of the heatmaps. By analyzing these heatmaps, we can gain insights into the variations and relationships between each of these features within the torus structure**

<!-- ```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE} -->
<!-- grid.arrange(hmap[[1]], nrow = 1, ncol=1) # fig.height=4,fig.width=8 -->
<!-- grid.arrange(hmap[[2]] ,nrow = 1, ncol=1) -->
<!-- grid.arrange(hmap[[3]], nrow = 1, ncol=1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r hmp level two quantization torus x demo,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 6: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 and number of cells 900 with the heat map overlaid for variable x in the ’torus’ dataset',eval = global_var}
muHVT::hvtHmap(
  hvt.torus3,
  torus_df,
  child.level = 1,
  hmap.cols = "x",
  line.width = c(0.4),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  palette.color = 6,
  centroid.size = 0.8,
  show.points = T,
  quant.error.hmap = 0.1,
  n_cells.hmap = 15
)
```

```{r hmp level two quantization torus y demo,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 7: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 and number of cells 900 with the heat map overlaid for variable y in the ’torus’ dataset',eval = global_var}
muHVT::hvtHmap(
  hvt.torus3,
  torus_df,
  child.level = 1,
  hmap.cols = "y",
  line.width = c(0.4),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  palette.color = 6,
  centroid.size = 0.8,
  show.points = T,
  quant.error.hmap = 0.1,
  n_cells.hmap = 15
)
```

```{r hmp level two quantization torus z demo,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 8: The Voronoi tessellation for layer 1 and number of cells 900 with the heat map overlaid for variable z in the ’torus’ dataset',eval = global_var}
muHVT::hvtHmap(
  hvt.torus3,
  torus_df,
  child.level = 1,
  hmap.cols = "z",
  line.width = c(0.4),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  palette.color = 6,
  centroid.size = 0.8,
  show.points = T,
  quant.error.hmap = 0.1,
  n_cells.hmap = 15
)
```

## Step 4: Prediction(predictHVT)

Lets have a look at out test dataset before we pass it to predictHVT function for scoring

```{r}
Table(head(testTorus))
```

However, let's try to comprehend the **predictHVT function** first before moving on

```{r predictHVT function1,echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
predictHVT(data,
                  hvt.results,
                  hmap.cols = NULL,
                  child.level = 1,
                  ...)
```

The important parameters for the function `predictHVT` are as below

* __`data`__ - A dataframe containing the test dataset. The dataframe should have atleast one variable used for training. The variables from this dataset can also be used to overlay as heatmap

* __`hvt.results`__ - A list of hvt.results obtained from the HVT function while performing hierarchical vector quantization on training data

* __`hmap.cols`__ - The column number of column name from the dataset indicating the variables for which the heat map is to be plotted. A heatmap won't be plotted if NULL is passed (Default = NULL)

* __`child.level`__ - A number indicating the level for which the heat map is to be plotted (Only used if hmap.cols is not NULL)

* __`...`__ - color.vec and line.width can be passed from here

Now once we have built the model, let us try to predict using our test dataset which cell and which level each point belongs to.

```{r predictHVT torus,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
predictions_torus <- muHVT::predictHVT(
  testTorus,
  hvt.torus3,
  child.level = 1,
  line.width = c(1.2),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  quant.error.hmap = 0.1,
  n_cells.hmap = 9000
)
```


Let's see which cell and level each point belongs to. For the sake of brevity, we will only show the first 10 rows

```{r predictHVT pred torus,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}

predictions_torus[["scoredPredictedData"]] %>% head(100) %>% 
  round(2) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  Table(scroll = T, limit = 10)
```


# Example II: muHVT with the Personal Computer dataset

**Data Understanding**

In this section, we will use the `Prices of Personal Computers` dataset. This dataset contains 6259 observations and 10 features. The dataset observes the price from 1993 to 1995 of 486 personal computers in the US. The variables are price, speed, ram, screen, cd, etc. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/SangeetM/dataset/blob/master/Computers.csv).

In this example, we will compress this dataset by using hierarchical VQ via k-means and visualize the Voronoi Tessellation plots using Sammons projection. Later on, we will overlay all the variables as a heatmap to generate further insights.

Here, we load the data and store into a variable `computers`.

```{r load data computer,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = T}
set.seed(240)
# Load data from csv files
computers <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mu-Sigma/muHVT/master/vignettes/sample_dataset/Computers.csv")
```

Let's explore the Personal Computers Dataset. For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.


```{r sample data computer,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = T}
# Quick peek

Table(head(computers), scroll = T, limit = 20)
```

Now, let us check the structure of the data and analyse its summary.

```{r data structure computer,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = global_var}
str(computers)
```


```{r data summary computer,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = global_var}
summary(computers)
```

Let us first split the data into train and test. We will use 80% of the data as train and remaining as test.

```{r train-test computer,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = global_var}
noOfPoints <- dim(computers)[1]
trainLength <- as.integer(noOfPoints * 0.8)
trainComputers <- computers[1:trainLength,]
testComputers <- computers[(trainLength+1):noOfPoints,]
```

K-means is not suitable for factor variables as the sample space for factor variables is discrete. A Euclidean distance function on such a space isn't really meaningful. Hence, we will delete the factor variables(X, cd, multi, premium, trend) in our dataset. 

Here we keep the original `trainComputers` and `testComputers` as we will use the variables from this dataset to overlay as heatmap and generate some insights.

```{r pre-processing data computer,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = global_var}
trainComputers <-
  trainComputers %>% dplyr::select(-c(X, cd, multi, premium, trend))
testComputers <-
  testComputers %>% dplyr::select(-c(X, cd, multi, premium, trend))
```

Now, lets have a look at the scaled training dataset containing (5007 data points). For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.

```{r}
trainComputers <- scale(trainComputers) 

metric_list <- colnames(trainComputers)
scale_attr <- attributes(trainComputers)

trainComputers1 <- trainComputers %>% as.data.frame() %>% round(4)
Table(head(trainComputers1))
```

Now, lets have a look at the scaled testing dataset containing (1252 data points). For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.


```{r}
testComputers <- scale(testComputers, center = scale_attr$`scaled:center`, scale = scale_attr$`scaled:scale`) 
testComputers1 <- testComputers %>% as.data.frame() %>% round(4)
Table(head(testComputers1))
```

As we are familiar with the structure of the computers data, we will now follow the following steps to get the predictions using the Computers dataset.

## Step 1: Data Compression

For more detailed information on Data Compression please refer to [section 2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#compress-vector-quantization) of this vignette.

We will use the `HVT` function to compress our data while preserving essential features of the dataset. Our goal is to achieve data compression upto atleast `80%`. In situations where the compression ratio does not meet the desired target, we can explore adjusting the model parameters as a potential solution. This involves making modifications to parameters such as the `quantization error threshold` or `increasing the number of cells` and then rerunning the HVT function again.

**In our example we will iteratively increase the number of cells until the desired compression percentage is reached instead of increasing the quantization threshold because it may reduce the level of detail captured in the data representation**


We will pass the below mentioned model parameters along with computers dataset to `HVT` function.

**Model Parameters**

* Number of Cells at each Level = 440
* Maximum Depth = 1
* Quantization Error Threshold = 0.2
* Error Metric = Max
* Distance Metric = Manhattan


```{r level one computers,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,results='asis',eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
hvt.results <- list()
hvt.results <- muHVT::HVT(trainComputers,   
                          n_cells = 440,
                          depth = 1,
                          quant.err = 0.2,
                          projection.scale = 10,
                          normalize = F,
                          distance_metric = "L1_Norm",
                          error_metric = "max",
                          quant_method = "kmeans",
                          diagnose = F)

```

Now let's check the compression summary. The table below shows no of cells, no of cells having quantization error below threshold and percentage of cells having quantization error below threshold for each level.

```{r compression summary level one computers,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}
compressionSummaryTable(hvt.results[[3]]$compression_summary)
```


**As it can be seen from the table above, __`81%`__ of the cells have reached the quantization threshold error. Since we are successfully able to attain the desired compression percentage, so we will not further subdivide the cells **

__`hvt.results[[3]]`__ gives us detailed information about the hierarchical vector quantized data.

__`hvt.results[[3]][['summary']]`__ gives a nice tabular data containing no of points, Quantization Error and the codebook.

The datatable displayed below is the summary from hvt.results


```{r summary level one computers,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}
summaryTable(hvt.results[[3]]$summary)
```

Now let us understand what each column in the above summary table means:

* __`Segment.Level`__ - Layers of the cell. In this case, we have performed Vector Quantization for depth 1. Hence Segment Level is 1

* __`Segment.Parent`__ - Parent segment of the cell

* __`Segment.Child (Cell.Number)`__ - The children of a particular cell. In this case, it is the total number of cells at which we achieved the defined compression percentage

* __`n`__ - No of points in each cell

* __`Cell.ID`__ - Cell_ID’s are generated for the multivariate data using 1-D Sammon’s Projection algorithm

* __`Quant.Error`__ - Quantization Error for each cell

All the columns after this will contain centroids for each cell. They can also be called a codebook, which represents a collection of all centroids or codewords.

## Step 2: Data Projection

For more detailed information on Data Projection please refer to [section 3](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#projection) of this vignette.

lets view the projected 2D centroids after performing sammon's projection on the compressed data recieved after performing vector quantization. For the shake of brevity we are displaying first six rows.



```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

hvt_torus_coordinates <-hvt.results[[2]][[1]][["1"]]
centroids <<- list()
  coordinates_value <- lapply(1:length(hvt_torus_coordinates), function(x){
    centroids <-hvt_torus_coordinates[[x]]
    coordinates <- centroids$pt
  })
centroid_coordinates<<- do.call(rbind.data.frame, coordinates_value)  
colnames(centroid_coordinates) <- c("x","y")
centroid_coordinates <- centroid_coordinates %>% data.frame() %>% round(4)
Table(head(centroid_coordinates))

```

## Step 3: Tessellation

For more detailed information on voronoi tessellation please refer to [section 4](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#voronoi-tessellations) of this vignette.

Now, we have obtained the centroid coordinates resulting from the application of Sammon's projection. 

For better visualisation, let's plot the Voronoi tessellation using the `plotHVT` function.

```{r plot level one computers,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 9: The Voronoi Tessellation for layer 1 shown for the 440 cells in the dataset ’computers’',eval = global_var}
# Voronoi tessellation plot for level one

 muHVT::plotHVT(hvt.results,
        line.width = c(0.2), 
        color.vec = c("#141B41"),
        centroid.size = 0.01,  #1.5
        maxDepth = 1)


```    

Now let's plot the Voronoi Tessellation with the heatmap overlaid for all the features in the computers dataset for better visualization.

<!-- ```{r hmp level one quantization computers,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 3: The Voronoi Tessellation with the heat map overlaid for all the variables in the ’computers’ dataset',eval = global_var} -->
<!-- metric_list <- colnames(trainComputers) -->
<!-- hmap <- list() -->
<!-- hmap <- lapply(1:length(metric_list), function(x){ -->
<!-- muHVT::hvtHmap( -->
<!--   hvt.results, -->
<!--   trainComputers, -->
<!--   child.level = 1, -->
<!--   hmap.cols = metric_list[[x]], -->
<!--   line.width = c(0.2), -->
<!--   color.vec = c("#141B41"), -->
<!--   palette.color = 6, -->
<!--   centroid.size = 0.01, -->
<!--   show.points = T, -->
<!--   quant.error.hmap = 0.1, -->
<!--   n_cells.hmap = 15 -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- }) -->
<!-- ``` -->

**The heatmaps displayed below provides a visual representation of the spatial characteristics of the computers data, allowing us to observe patterns and trends in the distribution of each of the features (price,speed,hd,ram,screen,ads). The <span style="color: #8FD400;">sheer green</span>  shades highlight regions with higher values in each of the heatmaps, while the <span style="color: indigo;">indigo</span>  shades indicate areas with the lowest  values in each of the heatmaps. By analyzing these heatmaps, we can gain insights into the variations and relationships between each of these features within the computers data**

<!-- ```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,eval=TRUE,fig.height=4,fig.width=8} -->

<!-- ``` -->

```{r hmp level one price computers,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',results='hide',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 10: The Voronoi Tessellation with the heat map overlaid over the variable price in the ’computers’ dataset',eval = global_var}

muHVT::hvtHmap(

## Step 4: Prediction(predictHVT)

For more detailed information on prediction please refer to [section 5](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Somya545/muHVT/blob/master/vignettes/muHVT_vignette4.html#prediction) of this vignette.

Now once we have built the model, let us try to predict using our test dataset which cell and which level each point belongs to.


```{r predictHVT function,echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
predictHVT(data,
                  hvt.results,
                  hmap.cols = NULL,
                  child.level = 1,
                  ...)
```

The important parameters for the function `predictHVT` are as below

* __`data`__ - A dataframe containing the test dataset. The dataframe should have atleast one variable used for training. The variables from this dataset can also be used to overlay as heatmap

* __`hvt.results`__ - A list of hvt.results obtained from the HVT function while performing hierarchical vector quantization on training data

* __`hmap.cols`__ - The column number of column name from the dataset indicating the variables for which the heat map is to be plotted. A heatmap won't be plotted if NULL is passed (Default = NULL)

* __`child.level`__ - A number indicating the level for which the heat map is to be plotted (Only used if hmap.cols is not NULL)

* __`...`__ - color.vec and line.width can be passed from here

```{r predictHVT hmap computers,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval = global_var}
set.seed(240)
predictions <- muHVT::predictHVT(
  testComputers,
  hvt.results,
  child.level = 1,
  line.width = c(1.2),
  color.vec = c("#141B41"),
  quant.error.hmap = 0.2,
  n_cells.hmap = 440
)
```


Let's see which cell and level each point belongs to. For the sake of brevity, we will only show the first 10 rows

```{r predictHVT pred computers,warning=FALSE,eval = global_var}

predictions[["scoredPredictedData"]] %>% head(100) %>% 
  round(2) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  Table(scroll = T, limit = 10)
```


We can see the predictions for the points in the table above.The centroid of the cell that the point is mapped to is the codeword (predictor) for that cell. 

# Executive Summary

* **Example I: muHVT with the Torus dataset**

*  We have considered torus dataset for multidimensional data visualization using sammons projection.

*  Our goal is to achieve data compression upto atleast `80%`

* We constructed a compressed HVT map (hvt.torus) by applying the HVT() on the torus dataset. We set the parameters as   follows: `n_cells = 100`, `quant.error = 0.1`, and `depth = 1`. Upon analyzing the compression summary, we found that none    of the  100 cells exceeded the quantization threshold error.

* We created another compressed HVT map (hvt.torus2) using the HVT() algorithm on the torus dataset. This time, we adjusted     the parameters to `n_cells = 300`, `quant.error = 0.1`, and `depth = 1`. After examining the compression summary, we          discovered that 14% of the cells have reached the quantization threshold error.

* Once again, we generated a compressed HVT map (hvt.torus3) using the HVT() algorithm on the torus dataset. The parameters     for this map were set to `n_cells = 900`, `quant.error = 0.1`, and `depth = 1`. Upon analyzing the compression summary, we    found that 93% of the 100 cells have reached the quantization threshold error and we can clearly visualize the 3D torus(donut) in 2D   space.

* **Example II: muHVT with the Personal Computer dataset**

*  We have considered computers dataset for generating predictions to see which cell and level each point belongs to.

*  Our goal is to achieve data compression upto atleast `80%`

*  We construct a compressed HVT map using the HVT() on the training dataset by setting __`n_cells`__ to 440 and  __`quant.error`__ to 0.2, and we were able to attain a compression of 81%

* We then plot the Voronoi Tessellation with the heatmap overlaid for all the features in the computers dataset for better visualization

* Next, we pass the validation dataset along with the HVT map obtained from `HVT()` to `predictHVT()`  to see which cell and level each   point belongs to

# Applications 

1. Pricing Segmentation - The package can be used to discover groups of similar customers based on the customer spend pattern and understand price sensitivity of customers

2. Market Segmentation - The package can be helpful in market segmentation where we have to identify micro and macro segments. The method used in this package can do both kinds of segmentation in one go

3. Anomaly Detection - This method can help us categorize system behavior over time and help us find anomaly when there are changes in the system. For e.g. Finding fraudulent claims in healthcare insurance

4. The package can help us understand the underlying structure of the data. Suppose we want to analyze a curved surface such as sphere or vase, we can approximate it by a lot of small low-order polygons in the form of tessellations using this package

5. In biology, Voronoi diagrams are used to model a number of different biological structures, including cells and bone microarchitecture

6. Using the base idea of Systems Dynamics, these diagrams can also be used to depict customer state changes over a period of time
